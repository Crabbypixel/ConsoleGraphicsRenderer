# ConsoleGraphicsRenderer

ConsoleGraphicsRenderer is a simple command-line graphics renderer used to draw 2D graphics onto the screen.

This was small project I worked upon to learn about game and graphics programming during 2024 summer vacations.

The window managing events are completely handled by using Windows API calls and hence The ConsoleGraphicsRenderer only works on Windows Operating System.

Since ConsoleGraphicsRenderer uses the command prompt to render objects onto the screen, it is limited to 16-bit color display.

The ConsoleGraphicsRenderer is notorious for lower frame rates when it comes to render several objects due to CPU-based rendering and running in a command-line window.
